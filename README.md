# SatPC32-and-the-IC-9700

I wrote this document with the help of Pete (KD9VV). It explains
some of the hurdles we muddled our way through in making the 
Icom IC-9700 work with the SatPC32 satellite tracking program.

The information is not only from out first-hand experience, but
from a number of other sources including the user manuals for 
the IC-9700 and SatPC32 as well as posts on the IC-9700 user
group (https://groups.io/g/ic-9700/topics).

Some of the information included also applies to using SatPC32
in general regardless of the radio being used; for example, I
explain how to set up the DxLabs suite of programs (Commander,
DxKeeper and DxView) to enable semi-automatic logging with
SatPC32.

Update 03/24/2021 - Release 1.1 adds a picture of what the 
radio should look like when properly set up for the CAS-4A
satellite.
